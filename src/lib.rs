//! ðŸ—ž Brokaw is a NNTP (Usenet) library
//!
//! # APIs
//!
//! Brokaw provides two primary APIs for interacting with NNTP servers:
//!
//! 1. The [`NntpClient`] provides a higher-level that provides a a config
//! based builder and automatic deserialization of responses into different types.
//! 2. The [`NntpConnection`] provides a lower-level abstraction that
//! only provides validation that messages adhere to NNTP's wire format.
//!
//! Brokaw additionally provides strongly typed [commands](types::command),
//! [responses](types::response), and the [`NntpCommand`](types::NntpCommand)
//! trait for implementing your own strongly typed commands.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! Please check out the [git repository](https://github.com/sgg/brokaw) examples.
